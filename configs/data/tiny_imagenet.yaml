name: tiny_imagenet
location: /content/drive/MyDrive/data/tinyimagenet/ # Root directory for the Tiny ImageNet dataset

# --- Dataset Characteristics ---
num_classes: 200  # Tiny ImageNet has 200 classes
image_size: 64    # Original image size (height and width) for Tiny ImageNet
channels: 3       # Number of image channels (e.g., 3 for RGB)

# --- Data Structure (paths relative to 'location') ---
# These define where the train, validation, and (optionally) test sets are.
# Adjust them if your Tiny ImageNet directory structure is different.
train_folder: train                     # Subfolder for training images
val_folder: val                         # Subfolder for validation images
# Tiny ImageNet's validation set often requires an annotations file to map images to their correct class folders/labels.
val_annotations_file: val/val_annotations.txt
# test_folder: test                     # Subfolder for test images (often unlabeled, if present)

# --- Data Preprocessing Parameters --- #
mean: [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] # Example: ImageNet mean for normalization
std: [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]  # Example: ImageNet std for normalization

# --- Optional: Data Loader Parameters ---
# These might also be part of a main training configuration.
# batch_size: 64
# num_workers: 4
