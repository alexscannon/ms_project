# Masters Project: Continual Novelty Detection in Data Streams

## Introduction
This project has three phases: (1.) OOD Detection (2.) Continual Learning (3.) Novelty Detection.

### Pretraining
There are two jupyter notebooks in the "pretrain" directory which train two Vision Transformer ("ViT") models on different datasets. The first dataset is CIFAR-100 and the second is Tiny-ImageNet.

### Phase 1: OOD Detection

### Phase 2: Continual Learning

### Phase 3: Novelty Detection
