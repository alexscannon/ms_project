# Masters Project: Continual Novelty Detection in Data Streams

## Introduction
This project has three phases: (1.) OOD Detection (2.) Continual Learning (3.) Novelty Detection.

## Repo Set Up Instructions
1. Create virtual env (ex., "conda create --name <my_env_name> python=3.10")
- Ensure virtual env is installed with python v3.10 or up. Numpy 2.0 is not supported in python v3.8.0.
2. Activate virtual env (ex., "conda activate <my_env_name>)
3. Install requirements.txt (ex., "pip install -r requirements.txt")

### Pretraining
There are two jupyter notebooks in the "pretrain" directory which train two Vision Transformer ("ViT") models on different datasets. The first dataset is CIFAR-100 and the second is Tiny-ImageNet.

### Phase 1: OOD Detection

### Phase 2: Continual Learning

### Phase 3: Novelty Detection
